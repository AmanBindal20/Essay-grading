Between cinematic effect rivaled by even few movies and other elements, I have yet to see a tv series match it or even come close. Before Game of Thrones with the exception of Breaking Bad and maybe a few other series, very few had kept me glued from beginning to end. It also did what few have done and not only kept you guessing from episode to episode (whether it be who falls in love, who changes from good to evil, who dies, who comes back, new relationships made, old friendships ending and so on)but also built from the first season to the last progressively. It had an extremely grounded, reastic, morbid, grim, brutal, sad, and other negative effects type of storytelling with few bouts of positive triumph, but that's what made it amazing. Because the dark moments sure become so much lighter when everything seems to be lost. Although many won't approve because of the liberal use of nudity, sexualism, profanity and graphic violence, I defend it wholeheartedly. What in the news and nowadays otherwise is all that much different, at least this one has good writing and equal elements of good. The art direction is impeccable, the writing and acting are perfect across the board, and the visual effects and practical effects are outstanding, especially given this is a tv series and they are better than what most fantasy movies put out. I can't applaud the actors enough, the supporting actors made most lead actors in other series look like amateurs, the leads made most of those in their class look like supporting actors and the good definitely made it easy to cheer for them while the evil were more than capable of carrying out a good effort for people to hate them. If you are into fantasy, medieval, or just good acting entertainment in general and can at least sit through the elements that you consider obscene or over the top, you will love this show - frankly I find it almost impossible to hate it.
