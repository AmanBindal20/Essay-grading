And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And thats when he gets unpatient. No matter what he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around and walk back to the group. Meany times I have tried training him to be patient but I have always failed.

7,Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have savere anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family!!! They had grandkids that really annoyed me!!! My foster family had a different religion than me I am atheist. They are @CAPS1 and they would constantly tell me I am wrong!!! It made me very upset but I didnt say nothing because I was being patient. And I hate it. With my anger problems im very surprised I didnt go off on them? But yes patience does take practice lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient!!! Tolerance twords children I dont like kids to much but where I wed to live there were tons of little kids that were the grand kids of my foster family and I sued those kids are annoying but I had to tolerate them.

When we got going I had to wait for over @NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun.

As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows, and shimied up the trunk of an ancient oak. Both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 waited for several hours before seeing a dane , and when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready,@CAPS4 of this @PERSON2 got to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead the the dane fled into the treeline. @CAPS5 did you not take the shot? whispered @PERSON1. @CAPS6 was to far away my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 wiithout pain. @PERSON2 replied simply.The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared. This time though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready,but @PERSON2 had rites to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The danes rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was stai ring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply steped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. @CAPS5 did you not take the shot? whispered @PERSON1. @CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6s back turned. @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walks through the grove from the left this time giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank.This shot @PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies tree and pierces the animals lungs and heart. @CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased. @PERSON2 states as he corries his kill from the woods. In the end , patience rewards better than impatience.

I new I had to be patient. But I wanted to get there so bad. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble. I know that because I had to learn the way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking to long. Then when we got home later on that hight I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking to long. So on our way to my grandmas cottage I didnt complain. Not complaining is smart to do. If you are unpatient dont go on long trips. Its good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandmas my mom was happy with me.

7,"@CAPS1! Look out! @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Heres a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. Its unbearable to watch. Ambulences sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And thats @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, Id lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadnt made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, Id still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe its just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldnt know because in no way we we typical. When we arent fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. @CAPS4, @CAPS5 starts, I know I havent been patient with you lately, and for that Im sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing. I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself? @CAPS5 didnt have to explain any farther. @CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around, my voice caught in my throat, just to get my stupid notebook. A single tear weaved its way down my face. @CAPS7, hunny! my mother teared up as @CAPS6. That doesnt make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way! I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. @CAPS8, I said, regaining composure, thats how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8. @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mothers lips. I will wait then. And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there.

7,"One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you  are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one.I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree.I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didnt blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldnt have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you.",24,0.8225139353505259,0.8571189685339755,0.7616172200358973,0.40123551051451334,0.8571189685339755,6.445665022952736,0.805708127869092,0.5,0.594174994954124,0.6904821213675311,0.5345671734516153,1.0340609180817841,[0.77203017],[0.89628074],[0.71791832]

He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television, the helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birth day or not .He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it so he kept bugging me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying .I did not, because I knew if I did I would get in trouble. So I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didnt work, because he kept on asking me any way. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over. Finally he stopped asking me about the helicopter and after we ate cake, we actually had to remind him about it. When he opened his presents, he did get a helicopter.

"" @CAPS6 months?""  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS6 months I don't have enough time to thank about that stuff, there are more important things to consider,"" @CAPS2 mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in @CAPS2 entire life.

I led nearly exploded from happiness. ""@CAPS3! "" @CAPS12 I had started in do a dance that no one understood not even  me.

Even worse was waiting for the disney busses to get back to your hotel. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patients through all of the waiting.

7,I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didnt keep my mouth shut so my mom didnt want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. Thats exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy.

We had to wait another two weeks until we started  on our back flips, but I really wanted to try it out. I rolled my eyes at @ORGANIZATION1's answer, and continued to practice my back-hard-springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called @PERSON1 so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and @PERSON1 was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. ""@CAPS2!"" I yelled.

7,"Patience is important in life. Something when you dont have patience things tend to go wrong and thats not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you dont have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldnt talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didnt have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didnt you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didnt have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didnt work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didnt get the shoes. Those were some people who didnt have patience.

7,"In your own way about patience. How do you show patience you dont be rude and you just stand there and wait until your turn. To me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments. For example one time my mom friend was patience for her because she had to wait for her as my mom exchange my brother helment. When I was in the store my cousin was patience out an outfit and I was taking a long time. When my brother and I was in the shore he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patience. I didnt get mad or made rude comments. One time me and my nephew was in the store, and I was ordering some food and he made rude comments but he was impatience.

It is important to have patients  because In life its not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient. Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game.

He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great.

We were babysitting twin four-months old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when her baby, @PERSON3, spit up on her too.

When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring.

7,I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience Ive had was hunting. You just have to sit there not talk and stay still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1 and we got out there at six-o-clock am and the waited there until nine oclock at night. The dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didnt even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves.

7,Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail. A time when I had to use patiences was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines. I couldnt think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time.

7,Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you dont complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days.

Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system @CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. @CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms? my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold ro and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom.",24,0.9047190227423488,0.9573762056123373,0.8604555506721612,0.49268573557511425,0.9573762056123373,8.948518819692662,0.8948518819692661,0.56,0.4336927332279761,0.528288650886689,0.2919718972355481,0.956800255350588,[0.7087966],[0.93328731],[0.64286286]

7,Patience for me is when im helping others with their problems so in this story im going describe to you what is patience. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience cause I sit down all the time and help people with their problem. One day at my old school @PERSON1 this girl she was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school she was crying. I went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying the way she doesnt want to be at home because he mom dont let her go nowhere she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion I really felt like I had patience and since that day forward I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems.,19,0.8577192463300033,0.8934436808894337,0.7881038621453778,0.4235384958845607,0.8934436808894337,6.760426068215089,0.8450532585268862,0.4375,0.5312268448093981,0.6509932992813711,0.4616412440641902,1.00745348724006,[0.75624407],[0.9215259],[0.6770372]

Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, shes transferred everything, Ive proved Im deticated, Ive kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, Ive been watching the neighbors pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and Im working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, Ive been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isnt sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. Ill probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, Ill have to continue everything Im doing now. So, I wont be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom!

7,I was patient when I was going to cedar point. We took a bas it took seven @CAPS1. So my friend @PERSON1 decided in watch movies on the @CAPS2. We watched street dreams and the incredible. We were still a long way from cedar point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilerious so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually we both fell asleep. When we woke up we were there. This it the time I waited patiently.  Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now.

Being patience in the game of chess or checkers is important because while the other persons makes his or her move  you can be thinking of what move you will make to counter attack it.

For example, everyone is excited on @CAPS1 eve and cant wait till morning but they have to be patient and wait till morning.

Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes wont go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since Im not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didnt once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didnt yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldnt have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I wouldve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. Im amazed at my moms understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too.",24,0.9530256858853895,0.9701238840448443,0.9288466999823095,0.5478143116801145,0.9701238840448443,11.699886200357255,0.9489860832450756,0.4473684210526316,0.30471938153708555,0.3772354702773603,0.2444426965779746,0.9022048795344416,[0.66971515],[0.83193966],[0.59990135]
7,One day when I went to the doctors to get shots my mom said I was very patient. My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flue shots like every other year when we got in the car to go I kept saying do we really have to go of  course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a little bit my mom had to get the papers so I just standed there and watched the fish swim around then my mom said lets go in the waiting room. After that she said I had been very patient for waiting except for in the car when I was whinning. So I said thanks and when are we going to get in there. Then when we finally get in there I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions the the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm she said you are like almost the only one of are kid patients that has it been patient.

7,A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient excepcially when it is all sold out. For example when I was waiting in line for a shirt the line was really long so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patient because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and their were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many ways we had to be patient like parking getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break I went to get a pop and all the lines where long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case that wasn@CAPS1 mine. I went back drank my pop and watched the show. Everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need.

One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I.

7,"Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, youre quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when youre waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates arent doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that youve lost, and youve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened Ive experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what Im trying to say is that when youre patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isnt a bundle of roses all the time, so soon or later, youre going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isnt human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, Im certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently.",16,0.9196819853109377,0.9687818080836197,0.8862403484807018,0.4256565766325818,0.9687818080836197,9.641430748571082,0.9110295729846571,0.5714285714285714,0.3977329417707285,0.4769898353619254,0.24987273527290038,1.013743292479476,[0.75580539],[0.92038997],[0.69381222]

7,Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesnt listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesnt have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect!

You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If its @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient.

7,"This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though Im empty on the inside, i goess. Theres gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. Hes always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. Hes useless now, but Im patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that its not just @CAPS2 who Im waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sight. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me hed seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasnt just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. Hes gone hasnt showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. Im patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient.

7,"Being patient means that your understanding and tolerant, I have been patient too. When I went fishing I have never caught a fish before. I would sit there and do nothing. Not complaining , not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person but I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself when ever some one caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I turned nine I went to a friends home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and feels. I didnt have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something bigs tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water. A reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldnt break.

When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often dont meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  @CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of youngs incorporated.  @CAPS3, youre with youngs?  @CAPS4 asked.   Do you know where the show room is?  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking.

7,"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that.

7,"Two summers ago, I helped out with kids camp at my church. I helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. They were very exited and roudy. They were always running around and shouting. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later on this week, I was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldnt sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted. It was hard to stay calm. Dispite the hardship I managed to be patient and calm. The little boy decided  I was all right and started to behave.

It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision. After the women went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girls tooth pulled.

And I was thinking, @CAPS1 long does it take for a few people to get shots @CAPS2 that I can leave? @CAPS2 I had to just sit there for about half- an- hour until my name was called. Then once I got into a back room I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign papers and what not, and also for the doctor to get the shots ready for what my mom told them to give me. But in the end I got to go home and play with my friend. This is once of many times that I had to be patient. And at least I still got to play with my friend. I hope you liked it.",20,0.8882003264732076,0.9335617257610539,0.8355284691228565,0.47310589596369257,0.9335617257610539,7.633981061412425,0.8756776837789508,0.5263157894736842,0.4701920302509508,0.5735355801990729,0.3645223566228716,0.9661329283358675,[0.72121476],[0.92455509],[0.63454906]

I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 second long.

My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as Im older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I dont care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and dont want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and dont say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why.

Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever.  Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you dont have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something.

I pulled on my camofage and hunters orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in its place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt.

The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom.

What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family.

My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday. One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it. Lastly patience is important because without patience wouldn't be able to read.

I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didnt even know that means, but if Im patient Ill probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it.",12,0.8027703347665831,0.8859521346401141,0.7028833329624775,0.4185893636734803,0.8859521346401141,5.439747174089538,0.7851598738210251,0.4166666666666667,0.6244398660147017,0.7708653151329647,0.4775936878977489,1.0048625686493087,[0.75769003],[0.9402435],[0.64978408]

7,"The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only suppose to be three ours long but one of cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. They had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. We waited at a gas station and they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriatly for use. There were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. After we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all signs of kings that said @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead and even of course when we got there I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said @CAPS1 to .@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1!

7,"Patience is a key role in life. If you are not paitent, you will live an unhappy life. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just cant stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. Im around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen.",12,0.8679803736895357,0.9170523795415761,0.8132949614059393,0.4249233733596762,0.9170523795415761,7.276424374610808,0.8575348363463975,0.4444444444444444,0.5106910457971141,0.6110728902415175,0.407302394931392,1.0103163830180555,[0.75630919],[0.90872924],[0.70493633]

7,Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I dont have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world dont have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span.

7,"Being patient is important, as Ive learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself.

My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldnt fight.

If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake.

Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion we all learnt to be patient sometimes.

7,"Patience @MONTH1 seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if its a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldnt believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dads dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is.

Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9. @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11.

Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! Its very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I cant help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a sniff, sniff, sniff sniff, snot. Were not aloud to get up, so were stuck sniff, sniff, snot-ing  all hour long. When you were a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, its none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, thats better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares.

Tried and tried but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally after four months of doing this I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day my coach told me I told you that you could do it it just takes time and patience but today was your day and you did it. This is a time I had to use patcience to get my new skill.

Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didnt care too, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3.

Of course. It didnt exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didnt want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. Ive slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time.

For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better.

7,"I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like shes about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says theyre all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew Id do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 kids and a war. I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. Its too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled, @CAPS1 @PERSON1, thats not nice, please stop. @CAPS2 stops for about @NUM2 way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about @CAPS3 when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, when we finish learning the alphabet A-@CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!: I realized tothem thats like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldnt believe my ears. Every kid learned A-@CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking.

7,"This year I tried out for the @NUM1  grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For bragging rigts,we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didnt play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like its the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadnt played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, can you do it?I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best!

7,"I think patient is when some one is able to wait and not complain. I was never patient, so here is a story I have made up. One day there was a girl named @CAPS1. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework., chores, take care of her sister and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because are she had was a math work shect ?? @NUM1 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were ?? addition and subtracts. That took her @NUM2 minutes, (@NUM3 on each side) which isnt that bad. Next she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister toys here all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that shes resting and not making man of mess, @CAPS2 took @CAPS1 about @NUM4 minutes to clean up all the days because all she bad to do was throw them back into the toy bar. Now , we go to her room. Ally messy room you first couldnt open the door. So she had to tog on the door until she could finally fit her self in. The door slammer shut from all the clothes but luckily didnt wake up her sister. @CAPS1 first made a check list of what she needed to do she had to: vacuum, fix her bed , and put all the food away that were in her room back in the kitchen. That took about @NUM5 hour and a half. So in all thats been about @NUM5:45 minutes. Now all she had to do clean up the rest of the dinner.  Her mom couldnt because she had to drop off her dad at the air part for work, so @CAPS2 was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had speghettl for dinner and her sister spilled the house all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took @NUM7 minutes, mopped which took like @NUM4 minutes, when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time.",16,0.9423491221229044,0.9810588636151542,0.8995046406414731,0.5754592109272336,0.9810588636151542,10.746975685474789,0.9354041679701651,0.48484848484848486,0.33599801121339207,0.44831988436500797,0.19463368868130754,0.8756638744054577,[0.64823955],[0.85747951],[0.5724147]

Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didnt seem like much. When we got into the store thats when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said @CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients? Ill try. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said @CAPS4 you for your patients. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said Do you see what happens if you be patient? I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have.

7,Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time thats a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness thats a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you dont have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldnt complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.,7,0.8978141080843332,0.9431312554125341,0.8545225434095608,0.5055443244231433,0.9431312554125341,7.894507920339827,0.8826328179395174,0.5,0.4491675861398243,0.5394023666808284,0.33724989128972616,0.9376800329969399,[0.69962501],[0.88206263],[0.61935408]

7,"This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something   gets you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, youll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you cant, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you dont hurt their feelings if they cant do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both dont get in trouble. If you wouldnt have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience.

7,"Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you dont have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didnt want to wait so she didnt look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldnt really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So thats what happens when you dont have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys.

Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what theyre doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down.

What he had to be patient about though was getting @CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @CAPS1 to go to the deep end of the pool but I was to afraid I would drown. So then he decided he needed to get @CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told @CAPS1 to jump in, but he shouldve realized I wouldnt just jump in. He did eventually get @CAPS1 into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with @CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @CAPS1. I told him if he stayed, Id go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasnt so bad after all.

In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something dont rush because you can mess up. Dont go way to slow because then people will think you dont know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to.

I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was.

I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldnt do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me @CAPS2! @CAPS3 wouldnt let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. Thats a time Ill never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. Thats how I was patient, and Im glad I was patient with my legs.

7,Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too.

7,"This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't.

The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there.

Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing!

I see that the subjects fingerprints are on the chip, I pull out my laptop at insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if Im able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but a tablecloth, Im sure I can sit here and just be patient.  At least twenty minutes have gone by now but i feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 wassucsessful. @CAPS2! I say aloud and people start to stare, but I dont mind. I click the square on the screen that says open. @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says @CAPS4 me at the ice cream pallor. I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone , and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf diaped over her head are the only two people standing by the icecream stand. I walk a little bit closer and i realise that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcaffs ofcoure, they were both working with the main suspect.

After what seemed @NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked âhow long has @CAPS3 been since we sat down?â âabout five minutes.â @CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. âhow long?â âsix now.â @CAPS3 wouldnât have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. âThe performance will start in @NUM7 minutes.â @CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over.

Now that youve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Lets say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten",15,0.8642303984964996,0.9054017220197768,0.8282606502856104,0.3974079379432768,0.9054017220197768,7.032670387527615,0.8528365540567601,0.5294117647058824,0.5191909196598156,0.5860705584046849,0.43496730447293025,1.0318476659782183,[0.77503594],[0.87287652],[0.72903487]

Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and youd have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish.

Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an epicfail.

Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions.

I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldnt sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling.  Finally we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty.

She also supports me being a vegetarian even though it means making two meals in conclusion my mom is one of the most patient people I know.",16,0.8555326710707756,0.8867321073183891,0.8225437543218092,0.41557055062414483,0.8867321073183891,7.154746389816463,0.8431949483181983,0.6111111111111112,0.5362327914523213,0.5957453242421478,0.47595775585993116,1.0216010042036507,[0.76210084],[0.90582634],[0.70181799]
7,"A time when someone else I know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is very very busy. She was the president of a club named @CAPS1-@CAPS2 for about one or two years. But now that she is not the president anymore, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But with either position, she wasnt earning only money. So she decided that she would get a job. She started looking for jobs online and in the newspapers and things. She couldnt find a job that was right for her. She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job. She kept on looking and looking. She kept looking for about another year until, finally she found a job at @CAPS3.C.C. she now teaches a computer class for collage or older people. If she liked, she would have ended up with a job that didnt enjoy.",19,0.8175440347095739,0.8657509910931169,0.7639941943381311,0.41878930698468375,0.8657509910931169,5.98797031714445,0.8001761917473796,0.42857142857142855,0.6023586307281679,0.6870310119082964,0.5181679436377422,1.0128728365805308,[0.76003895],[0.89726733],[0.69954367]
7,"I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. Theyre so boring. Especially the @CAPS18 long weddings that take like two hours of people  just standing there on the after doing  nothing  Im not the most patient person, so thats probably why I hate long wedding. Now that is one long story about patience. Do we have to go? I moaned to @CAPS4 mother. @CAPS1 its @PERSON1s wedding and its important. @CAPS2. I had to surrender as I put on @CAPS4 new dress and got in the car. The wedding was all the wapin @LOCATION1. It usually takes only an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when he gets into a major traffic jam. @CAPS3 on! @CAPS4 sister yelled. I just kept quiet. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, dramatic event just shot out. The road we had to go down was closed. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to @LOCATION1. When we got a call from @CAPS4 grandma. @CAPS5? @CAPS4 mom answered. @CAPS7 are you? The ceremony just ended,  @CAPS8. Thats bad. Were in @LOCATION2, why? Has the reception @CAPS9 yet?  @CAPS10, but Im sure youll make it in time to be there,  @CAPS11. Thats good. @CAPS12. @CAPS12. @CAPS13, as if on we, he reached the reception. I was so happy to be there even if I do hate weddings. @CAPS14 you have @CAPS16? @CAPS4 mom asked as we arrvied home. @CAPS16? I asked. @CAPS17, I guess I @CAPS14, even the car ride was kind of @CAPS16.  @CAPS18? You tend not to be the patient type. @CAPS1 I said and I was proud.",22,0.8965306430736916,0.9277612830050866,0.8543808585191729,0.4185951310475113,0.9277612830050866,8.70475679145253,0.888425519753549,0.4583333333333333,0.4531649538262452,0.5396649728874897,0.3801018731732673,1.0221498602815435,[0.76054017],[0.88500441],[0.70073083]
7,"A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient because of the customers that were driving by or the mom to mom sale when we had to wait for people to come to our table. At the garage sale I had a lemonade sale. Out of both sales we made a lot of money but, still we had to take some stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun but, we had to go through it all and, price it. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because the people had bought the stuff we had a lot of fun doing a mom to mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty god! We did sell some stuff but, some of it we still had left to pack up and take home to donate. We hadto do a whole lot of work but I liked it a lot!",15,0.8258245948683123,0.872414668406159,0.7851115513940634,0.5067105532781648,0.872414668406159,6.116862472678173,0.8174001305277357,0.5,0.5882294998046207,0.655573716077661,0.5051442003900293,0.9362059292733165,[0.7002569],[0.80689702],[0.64033118]
