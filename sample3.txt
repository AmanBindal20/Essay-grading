Malaria (= Ague) is a widely known human disease. It is caused by infection with a pathogenic protozoan parasite of blood, the Plasmodium. Four species of Plasmodium,viz., P. vivax, P. falciparum. P. malariae and P. ovale, are so far known to infect human beings, causing different types of malaria. Female Anopheles mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium from person to person, thus serving as carrier or vector hosts.

Malaria is one of the most common diseases of mankind. It is more common in tropical and subtropical countries, especially in Africa and Asia, where millions are infected. It is responsible for the death and reduced resistance in large number of persons every year, the heaviest toll being the children under 4 years of age.

Due to WHO and NMEP (National Malaria Eradication Programme) of India, the malaria was effectively reduced but party owing to socio-economic factors and partly because of unexpected proliferation of DDT- resistant mosquitoes and drug-resistant parasites, the attempts to eradicate the infection have failed and the malaria is again on increase.

About 60 species of Plasmodium are known to cause malaria in reptiles, birds and mammals. According to Jahn, there are 4 species in man, 4 in monkeys, 15 in birds, 13 in reptiles, and one or more in buffalo, antelope, squirrels, bats and frogs.

Malarial parasites are found widely spread from 45°S to 63° N latitudes. Their endemic home is in the tropical zone, but they also occur in many temperate countries. Species infecting the migratory birds are spread all over the world. Some avian malarial parasites are confined to cold regions only. Species infecting reptiles have a localized distribution.
