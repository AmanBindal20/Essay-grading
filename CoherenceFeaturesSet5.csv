He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life.

For example in the memoir, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Which is obviously the mood of loving, because there all a loving family together.

For example, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united. A third reason why the author created does moods because the author's parent's werent just caring for themselves but for others also just like their children. For example, ""They come selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life."" Which means her parent werent just caring abalt them but the future for there son.

Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work.

The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt.

He is also very grateful for his parents unselfishness by moving to @LOCATION1 for his education not even putting the thought of work in their head.

5,"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood. I think the mood created in this story is love. My reason for thinking this is that the story talks about how the parents sacrificed everything to move to the @LOCATION1 so they would have a better life and so would their children. Another reason why love is the mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an undying gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and making the place he lived in feel like home.

They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows apretiation towards them, which then gives the reader a sense of gratefulness. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. He stated, ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In an neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This @CAPS2 gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. Narciso Rodriguez produce a mood of caringness and greatfulness throughout his memoir.",4,0.8856408621557212,0.940896847638798,0.8363899854875503,0.41443677260665057,0.940896847638798,8.209543160833736,0.8751402414210273,0.3181818181818182,0.47586520199750315,0.572031493035916,0.34381143774226597,1.023605865511357,[0.7632792],[0.87173316],[0.6805472]

The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't his a real grandparents until 1970. He sounded a little deppressed about that. I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir.

5,"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author.",4,0.8943832793483263,0.9493838704435343,0.8275513243565445,0.4664692032546193,0.9493838704435343,8.282034282704084,0.8828678209771174,0.4090909090909091,0.4548984536950103,0.587279619335552,0.31817017319813584,0.9776285701460844,[0.72885769],[0.83864868],[0.65154839]

5,"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader.

5,"In the excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Narciso Rodriguez's Home: The @CAPS1 print of our Lives, the author creates a very warm, kind of theme by painting a picture in the reader's mind of a family long ago, that lived in unity and supported each other, pulling through in the very end. The author mentions several things from which one can infer the sensation of a strong supportive family that has everything it needs. As the author tells us, ""In 1961 @NUM1  family, blond  brick building created our traditional Cuban home very heart kitchen rich culinary skills and a love of cooking Passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (¶ @NUM1). This quote comes across with not just @CAPS2 meaning, but with a feeling that's hard to obtain  like when you're sitting around a campfire with friends and/or family. This feeling is created by the author's language, displaying a masterpiece to the reader. Language like ""very heart"" and ""warm house"" is what really conveys it.

In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet.""

5,"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family...""
